### Hi there, fellow developer, welcome to my bio card! ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸ˜„ About me:
I'm Daniel, a 20 year old full-stack (~and maybe lazy?~) developer working on improving my knowledgebase.

## ðŸ™Œ What i can do:
I am capable of developing Discord bots and am also able to develop basic dashboards for users to interact with.
I know 5 programming languages to develop stuff with: `JavaScript`, `HTML`, `CSS`, `Node.js` and `SQL`

## ðŸŒ± What i am learning:
I am currently self-learning on my knowledge and improving every day.
Database handling is also something i want to dig deeper into, even though i do somewhat know how to do such stuff.

## ðŸ“« Contact me:
You can currently reach out to me via Discord (`@emilinadaniel27`) or via E-Mail (`me@emilinadaniel27.dev`)

### âš¡ Fun fact:
By including "Fun fact:" before any word posted on the internet nowadays, that phrase is likely to make the reader giggle/laugh.
